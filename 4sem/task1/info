Question: What is elf file?
Answer: An ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file is a file format used by the 
Linux kernel and other Unix-like operating systems to store executable 
code, libraries, and object files. It is a type of relocatable file that 
can be linked with other files to create an executable program.

ELF files typically have a .elf extension and contain metadata about the 
contents of the file, such as the location and size of each section, the 
dependencies on other files, and the entry point for the program. They are
commonly used in embedded systems, where they provide a way to run 
programs that are designed to be run on a specific hardware platform.

ELF files can also be created using the GNU C compiler and linker, which 
produce ELF files as output. These files can be loaded into memory by the 
operating system and executed, allowing developers to write and test code 
in a development environment before deploying it to production.

question: ell me about compiling c code steps in Linux
Answer: Compiling C code on a Linux system involves several steps. Here's an 
overview of the process:

1. Write the C program: The first step is to write the C program that you 
want to compile. You can use any text editor or IDE (Integrated 
Development Environment) to write your code.
2. Save the file: Once you have written the code, you need to save it in a
file with a `.c` extension. For example, if your program is called 
"hello_world", you would create a file named `hello_world.c`.
3. Compile the code: To compile the C code, you need to use a compiler. In
Linux, the default compiler is called `gcc`. You can run the command `gcc 
hello_world.c` in your terminal to compile the program. The output of the 
compilation will be an object file named `hello_world.o`.
4. Link the object file: After compiling the code, you need to link the 
object file with the libraries that your program requires. You can do this
by running the command `gcc hello_world.o -o hello_world` in your 
terminal. This will create an executable file named `hello_world`.
5. Run the program: Finally, you can run the program by executing the 
executable file in your terminal. You can do this by running the command 
`./hello_world`. This will execute the program and display any output that
it produces.

Note: If you are using a different compiler than `gcc`, such as `clang` or
`icc`, you may need to use a different command to compile and link your 
code. Be sure to consult the documentation for your specific compiler to 
learn more about how to compile and link C code on Linux.
